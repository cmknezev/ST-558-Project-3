## PGA Tour FedExCup Points Project 

In the PGA Tour, players earn points in the FedExCup based on their placement at each tournament they participate in. The purpose of this project will be to investigate the relationship between a golfer's performance in different facets of their game (driving, putting, etc.) and the amount of points they are able to earn over the course of a season. We will also build models in order to predict the amount of points a player earns based on these metrics.   

The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jmpark746/pga-tour-data-2010-2018), and this data was scraped from [the PGA Tour website](https://www.pgatour.com/stats.html). The dataset contains data for golfers between the years 2010 and 2018.
